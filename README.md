This project investigates the application of deep learning techniques—specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and residual networks—for the task of weather forecasting. The central goal is to predict surface temperature using a set of atmospheric variables, leveraging the WeatherBench dataset. While accurate meteorological forecasting remains an immensely complex challenge beyond the scope of this notebook, the project serves as a proof of concept to explore how data-driven models can learn from structured climate data.

The workflow begins by setting a consistent random seed to ensure the reproducibility of results. Data preprocessing includes loading meteorological fields from the WeatherBench dataset and preparing them for input into neural networks. Various neural architectures are then constructed using Keras, ranging from standard convolutional layers to deeper residual configurations that aim to improve training dynamics and performance.

Though the models are not expected to produce operationally viable forecasts, they illustrate how spatial patterns in climate data can be modeled through modern deep learning tools. This work provides a foundation for more sophisticated experimentation in the intersection of machine learning and climate science.
